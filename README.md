The scope of this project was to create it in 3 differente ways using Vanilla JS:

1-. Plain and simple logic using functions.
2-. Refactoring it using class Book as a data structure template to work on and keeping the functions global. (class-refactor)
3-. Refactoring ut using class Book asn a data structure template and adding LibraryManager class as the workhorse for everything else. (class-refactor-v2)
